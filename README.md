# Optimizing Pandemic Policy: Data-Driven Strategies for COVID-19 Management

## Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of global COVID-19 policies to identify strategies that maintain:
- Case growth rates below 3%.
- Death growth rates below 1%.
- Minimal societal and economic disruption.

By leveraging international datasets and advanced analytical tools, this study provides actionable insights to guide evidence-based pandemic management.
